I am a first-year M.S. student at the [SNU AIDAS Lab](https://aidas.snu.ac.kr/), advised by Jaeyoung Do. My research lies at the intersection of **model editing and personalization** in generative AI: developing techniques for model merging, diffusion-based large language models, classifier editing, and user-driven personalization.
